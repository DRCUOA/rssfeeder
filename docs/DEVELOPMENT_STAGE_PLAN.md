# RSSFeeder Development Stage Plan

## Overview

This development plan breaks down the RSSFeeder project into logical, testable stages. Each stage must be fully implemented with comprehensive tests before proceeding to the next stage. Tests must be rerunnable as regression tests for future stages.

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test database interactions and API endpoints
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure previous stages continue working
- **Performance Tests**: Validate response times and throughput where applicable

## Stage Plan Updates

**Note:** This plan has been updated based on Stage B1 and B2 implementation learnings. Several infrastructure components and advanced features were implemented ahead of schedule, allowing later stages to focus on application-specific features rather than rebuilding infrastructure.

**Key Changes:**
- **B1 Updates**: B15, B16, B17 refocused to leverage existing infrastructure; D1 simplified due to existing setup automation
- **B2 Updates**: B3, B16, B17, B18 significantly simplified due to comprehensive authentication and security infrastructure
- **All stages**: Must integrate with established patterns for logging, error handling, database operations, authentication, and validation

**See `STAGE_PLAN_UPDATES_POST_B1.md` and `STAGE_PLAN_UPDATES_POST_B2.md` for detailed rationale and implementation patterns.**
